## **Introduction**

           ### **Welcome to Text Emotion Classification**
          
    This project aims to classify text using machine learning algorithm. You can enter a 
    sentence of you choice and click on "Classify" and it will label your mood.

## **Features**
    * Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions from text data.
    * Text Preprocessing**: Preprocess text data for training.
    * Model Training**: Train machine learning models for emotion classification.

## **Requirements**
    * Python 3.x
    * TensorFlow 2.x
    * Transformers library

## **Installation**
    1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Adi-ti09/text-emotion-classification.git`
    2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## **Usage**
    1. Run the script: `python app.py`
    2. Follow the prompts to classify text emotions.

## **Issues you may encounter**
    * Current version of tranformers is compatible with tf-keras. Please install it to avoid
      exception.
    * Ensure to install and the requirements in the same virtual environment.

## **Acknowledgement**
     This project was made possible by the open-source libraries and frameworks used, including:
         1. TensorFlow and its contributors for the machine learning framework
         2. Transformers library and its contributors for the pre-trained models
         3. Python and its community for the programming language
         
     I would also like to acknowledge the datasets used for training and testing, including:
           [www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp] for providing the text data for emotion classification. 

## **Limitations**
          While this project has achieved promising results in text emotion classification, there are several limitations to note:
              1. Limited dataset: The project was trained on a limited dataset, which may not be representative of all possible emotions and text styles.
              2. Cultural bias: The dataset and pre-trained models may contain cultural biases, which may affect the accuracy of the emotion classification.
              3. Contextual understanding: The project relies on machine learning algorithms to classify emotions, which may not always understand the nuances of human 
                 language and context.
              4. Emotion complexity: Emotions can be complex and multi-faceted, and the project may not be able to capture the full range of human emotions.
              5. Error propagation: The project uses pre-trained models and datasets, which may contain errors or biases that can propagate to the final results.
